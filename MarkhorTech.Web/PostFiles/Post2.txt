<div class="text">One piece of the puzzle is to incorporate the code and culture of open source. It is a central driver behind each and every one of these disruptive and successful companies. Each has woven in open source, from the code to the culture. This is the change happening and open source is how you can play a part. </div>
<div class="text">For decades open source software has made it possible for us to innovate from operating systems to programming languages. Releasing open source incubates not only individual businesses but evolves, creates, and sometimes lays waste to entire industries. Using open source, making your projects open source, and being an active part of the open source community is a necessary way to keep up with technology and be a part of a larger community. Think about all that brain power working toward your company's goals. Businesses that have been holdouts to truly incorporating open source into both their code and culture can no longer turn a blind eye to a deep and invasive change; they truly must transform or fade away. </div>
