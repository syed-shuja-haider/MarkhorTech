<div class="text">When it comes to planning, crafting, and deploying software or creating portals into your business for your customers, many considerations have to be weighed like budget, schedule, and enterprise goals, but none should take precedence over the actual customer. The customer could be an end user or another company, but if you create anything without researching and talking to your customers, all you are doing is guessing what is needed. You must put the customer front and center as you embark on iterations and new projects; their experience will decide your success. As technology innovation hastens and spreads to enterprises beyond the traditional tech industries, developers must take an active role in championing these drivers for success as we make the journey through this digital transformation. </div>
