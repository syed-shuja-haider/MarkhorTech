<div class="text">The software architecture and systems of a company are akin to a cardiovascular system in your average mammal. If you take care of that system, you can generally ensure a long, healthy life for yourself, and the same goes with any enterprise. However, it can be easy to overlook what may be happening internally while you are off paying attention to life (or business models). Schedules are overrun, security is broken, maintenance costs from patches to purchases run wild, and servers age and die. </div>
<div class="text">The good news is there have been great strides in delivery, deployment, and storage that will leave you focused on growing your business rather than ensuring its internal organs are in good working order in the form of XaaS, serverless architecture, distributed systems, containers, and microservices. You can leave that old model behind and continually have the shiniest new tech on the block by utilizing third-party services like OpenStack for its computing power, building reactive microservices to compartmentalize and focus segments of your architecture to create a much more resilient and scalable environment, and deploy software continuously with cloud-native tools like Docker and Kubernetes. </div>
