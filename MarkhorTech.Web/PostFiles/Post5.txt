<div class="text">Machine learning has officially heated up again (and for good) and this time the major players are choosing open source with the computing power behind it to make a significant impact across many industries. OpenAI (Elon Musk), Watson (IBM), TensorFlow (Google), and CNTK (Microsoft) have given rise to a wealth of excitement around new products (Alexa) and paradigms (voice-driven apps), and infrastructure automation. Partner that with the power of having heaps of big, open data sets and soon we will be aiding consumers via Siri, Cortana, and Alexa in ways that were not possible just months ago. This data-fed machine learning is starting to have a significant impact on how businesses are making decisions, how information is delivered, and is driving changes in how engineering and operations teams are set up, as lower-level tasks are no longer an issue. </div>
